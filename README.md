# DJS03 Project Brief: Book Connect - Abstractions

Dive into the delightful world of "Book Connect," where literary adventures await at your fingertips! Browse, explore, and uncover your next great read from a vast, vibrant collection. Whether you're a fan of thrilling mysteries, epic fantasies, or heartwarming romances, "Book Connect" brings the magic of books directly to you. Happy reading! 

The "Book Connect" project provides an opportunity for students to refine a fully functional version of an application. The focus of this project is to enhance the code's maintainability, extendibility, and readability by applying concepts of objects and functions for abstraction. This will not only streamline future modifications but also consolidate students' understanding of higher-level programming concepts, including documentation, Styleguides, and abstraction principles.

#### Discussion and Reflection

After completing the tasks, prepare a brief presentation for your coaching group on the following:
- The rationale behind the refactoring decisions made, including the choice of objects and functions.
- How abstraction has made the code more maintainable and extendable.
- Any challenges faced during the refactoring process and how they were overcome.
- Reflections on how this exercise has deepened your understanding of JavaScript programming concepts.

Refactoring for Readability and Maintainability

1. Rationale behind Refactoring:
Identified areas of the codebase requiring improved readability and maintainability.
Chose to refactor the code into objects and functions to promote modularity, reusability, and clarity because that was our task.

2. Abstraction for Maintainability and Extendability:
Abstracted basically everything into functions and objects, thus reducing code duplication and improving readability.
This also allows an easy addition of new features or modification of existing ones without affecting other parts of the application.

3. Challenges Faced and Overcoming Them:
getting the 'show more' button to work after refactoring things took me a really long time because upon inspection of the chrome browser, no errors were being shown, had to test things function by function until i found where the issue was(render books)

4. Reflections on Understanding JavaScript Concepts:
This exercise deepened understanding of JavaScript programming concepts in several ways.
I learnt the importance of abstraction in promoting code maintainability and scalability.
